<START>

What'll ye do when ye get lonely
With no one waitin' by yer side?
Ye've been runnin' and hidin' much too long
Ye know ye's just yer foolish pride

Layla, ye've got me on me knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't ye ease me worried mind?

I tried to give ye consolation
When yer old man had let ye down
Like a fool, I fell in love with ye
Ye turned me whole world upside down

Layla, ye've got me on me knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't ye ease me worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all me love's in vain

Layla, ye've got me on me knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't ye ease me worried mind?

Layla, ye've got me on me knees
Layla, I'm beggin', darlin' please
Layla, darlin', won't ye ease me worried mind?

<END>
Passed: False
