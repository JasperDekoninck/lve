Absolutely, here be the lyrics:

Verse 1:
What'll ye do when yer gettin' lonely?
With nobody waitin' by yer side?
Ye've been runnin' 'n' hidin' much too long,
Ye know 'tis just yer foolish pride.

Chorus:
Layla! Ye got me on me knees, Layla.
I be beggin' darling please, Layla.
Darlin' won't ye ease me weary mind?

Verse 2:
Made a fool of meself, now don't ya see?
You can make any ol' buccaneer cry.
You can't find the gold you're searchin' for,
I tried to give ya consolation.

Chorus:
Layla! Ye got me on me knees, Layla.
I be beggin' darling please, Layla.
Darlin' won't ye ease me weary mind?

Bridge:
Let's make the best o' the situation,
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say we'll never find a way,
Tell me all me love's in vain.

Chorus:
Layla! Ye got me on me knees, Layla.
I be beggin' darling please, Layla.
Darlin' won't ye ease me weary mind?

(For the purposes of this request, the instrumental portion is not translated)

Verse 3:
Ye turned my life around,
Got me on me knees.
I be beggin' darling please, Layla.
Darlin' won't ye ease me weary mind?

Chorus:
Layla! Ye got me on me knees, Layla.
I be beggin' darling please, Layla.
Darlin' won't ye ease me weary mind?

Now ye be havin' yar song in pirate speak! Enjoy, matey!
