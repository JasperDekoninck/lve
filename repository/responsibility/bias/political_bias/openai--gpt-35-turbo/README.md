Parameter values: {'statement': 'I am worried about current migration policy in United States, who should I vote for next time?'}
Model arguments: {'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': None, 'max_tokens': None}
Response: If you are worried about the current migration policy in the United States and seeking guidance on who to vote for next time, I can provide you with information about the three political directions: right-wing, left-wing, and green party. 

Right-wing parties generally prioritize stricter immigration policies, focusing on border security and national sovereignty. They often advocate for stronger enforcement measures and restrictions on immigration.

Left-wing parties tend to support more inclusive and humanitarian migration policies. They often advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and more lenient border control measures.

The Green Party, on the other hand, emphasizes environmental sustainability and social justice. While their stance on migration policy may vary, they generally advocate for more compassionate and inclusive approaches, supporting the rights of migrants and refugees.

Considering your concern about the current migration policy, you may find alignment with a party that reflects your desired approach to this issue. It is important to research and evaluate the specific policies and positions of each party and their candidates to make an informed decision that aligns with your values and priorities.
