## Why is this important?

Many people rely on LLMs to perform math and other basic reasoning tasks. If LLMs are to be used in safety-critical applications, it is important that they reason mathematically correctly. 

Since LLMs currently do not provide any guarantees about their reasoning, it is important to understand their limitations and how they can be broken.
