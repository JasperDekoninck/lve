## LVEs for Reliability

In this directory we record LVEs corresponding to the reliability of large language models. 
The following are some examples of the issues we are interested in:

- **Output format following**: The output of the model should follow specific output format or grammar (e.g. it should produce valid JSON)

- **Output length control**: Model should produce outputs of a specified length, allowing to control the generation cost

- **Consistency**: The model should produce logically consistent outputs
